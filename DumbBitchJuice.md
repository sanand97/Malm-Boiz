# What is Dumb Bitch Juice?
In January of 2020, the then-canonical residents of 1G, known affectionately as the "Malm Boiz" (Nikhil, Azraf, Jenny, and Sid), threw the infamous "Dumb Bitch Party" inspired by the Alice Longyu Gao song [Dumb Bitch Juice](https://open.spotify.com/track/3PIch19Ly5hNPPGf1PJefy?autoplay=true) that Nikhil heard at a 100 gecs concert. The centerpiece of this party was of course, the titular Dumb Bitch Juice. The recipe for this drink is a closely guarded 1G secret, but rumor has it that at least two different kids of Hawaiian Punch are involved. Other noteworthy events at this party include:
 1. Sid moving into the apartment earlier that day
 2. David (in his pre-1G days) threw up in a trash can
 3. A neighbor tried to join the party, got mad we said no, and called the cops. This started a weeks-long war that culminated in him accusing us of dumping our garbage in the hallway and leave trash outside our door like the horse head from Godfather.
# Artistic Evolution: From Juice to Blood
The Dumb Bitch Party (henceforth referred to the DBP) was the last party thrown in this apartment. Shortly after, a global pandemic started. To date, no one has proven or disproven a link between these 2 events. In the spirit of the first 4707 party since, we've decided to pay tribute to this important moment in 4707 history. But we made it spooky.

Boo.
